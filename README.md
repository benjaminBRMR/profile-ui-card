# Profile UI Card ðŸ™Œ

This website serves to show his current status of followers, references and work to others. You can also see the contact information of the person in question. 

This is my first attempt with SCSS and I will always try to improve. Parts of the code are copied and rewritten from other projects so that I can learn this language better.


# Color Palette

As you can see, almost only gradients were used, which you can see in the code.
